# GoodOmen

Accessibility plugin for FFXIV that allows users to recolor AoE indicators.<br/>
It allows you to apply a tint to ground AoE markers, enabling better visibility for colorblind players.

This is an early implementation that will be refined in later versions.

## Bug Reports

Bugs should be reported as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/chirpxiv/GoodOmen/issues), which helps me to easily keep track of them. I am unlikely to see direct messages.

## Installation

This is a plugin for Dalamud, which is available using [XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher).

Add the following repo URL under **Custom Plugin Repositories** in your Dalamud settings:

`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chirpxiv/GoodOmen/refs/heads/main/repo.json`

After installing, you can type the `/goodomen` command to access the plugin's settings.
